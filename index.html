  <p> It was a dark and stormy night... </p>
  <p> A lantern rested on an old oak table illuminating a dusty cabin with an exhausted man sleeping on a cot.</p>
  <p> The man was uneasily awoken by the sound of a crow chirping in the distance. </p>
  <p> Accustomed to sleeping light for predators and vanguards, he scanned the area before realizing that the sound was something else. </p>
